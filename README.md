## Short description of App 
The App consists of a Homescreen with a scrollable list of 6 cities. 
When clicked on the heart on top of the City Card, the user can save that favored City to the list of “Favourite Cities”.

When a city is chosen and clicked on it, the user will be forwarded to a Detailscreen, in which he/she can scroll through images of the city and get a familiarity of what it looks like. Additionally, the user can also read the provided Info section to gain knowledge about the city. If the city awakens the user’s interest, then the user can click on the box with the text “Sights”. And is then forwarded to the Sightsscreen which displays the top 4 sights in this city and their images.

Other Functionalities in DetailScreen:
- Hotels -> user is forwarded to a link with the best hotels in the chosen city. 
- Ticket-> user is forwarded to a link to book a flight to the chosen city. 
- Restaurants -> user is forwarded to a link with the best restaurants in the chosen city.
